This project proves how well Wicket's component model is designed:

  * it took only about 20 hours to program a reusable tree component
  * concise [http://code.google.com/p/wicket-tree/source/browse/trunk/wicket-tree/src/main/java/wickettree/nested/Subtree.html HTML templates]
  * only standard Wicket features were used (including excellent AJAX support)
  * reuse of many other Wicket components
  * no Javascript programming was needed

Many thanks to the Wicket team!
